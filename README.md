# Beer Store

We have a beer store and we need a front end application for it, so we can sell it online, the client has given us some designs and feature requirements.

- We must list all the beers on the store.
- When we click buy on a beer it should be added to the cart
- When we add beers to the cart it should stack all the beer types
- On the beer cart we should be able to add or remove them if  we want
- The total price should be adjusted as we add or remove on the cart
- when we click Checkout we should go to another view that lists the beers and prices.


### Stack Requirements
- React
- Redux
- Sagas
- Ducks(optional)
- SCSS or StyledComponents
- Webpack

The design you can decide, so be creative.
