Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"6.2","abvMax":"8","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.028","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:11"},"stock":17,"price":6.86},{"id":"L0eAAB","name":"Aunt Sally","nameDisplay":"Aunt Sally","description":"A Unique Dry-Hopped Sweet Tart Sour Mash Ale","abv":"5.7","srmId":5,"styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","labels":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/L0eAAB/upload_wSYV9H-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/L0eAAB/upload_wSYV9H-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/L0eAAB/upload_wSYV9H-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/L0eAAB/upload_wSYV9H-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/L0eAAB/upload_wSYV9H-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/L0eAAB/upload_wSYV9H-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-28 15:46:30","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","srm":{"id":5,"name":"5","hex":"FBB123"},"style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients. There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"},"stock":5,"price":13.59},{"id":"7iFx4r","name":"Beer Camp Across America","nameDisplay":"Beer Camp Across America (2014)","abv":"8.6","availableId":2,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","isRetired":"N","year":2014,"labels":{"icon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/7iFx4r/upload_KO0nmF-icon.png","medium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/7iFx4r/upload_KO0nmF-medium.png","large":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/7iFx4r/upload_KO0nmF-large.png","contentAwareIcon":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/7iFx4r/upload_KO0nmF-contentAwareIcon.png","contentAwareMedium":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/7iFx4r/upload_KO0nmF-contentAwareMedium.png","contentAwareLarge":"https://brewerydb-images.s3.amazonaws.com/beer/7iFx4r/upload_KO0nmF-contentAwareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-25 13:35:16","updateDate":"2018-11-02 02:15:14","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"stock":3,"price":12.79},{"id":"4jKDXK","name":"Beer Camp: West Coast DIPA","nameDisplay":"Beer Camp: West Coast DIPA (2017)","description":"It was a given that when Sierra Nevada and Boneyard join forces to make a beer,  you're gonna get some type of an IPA.
